            <li>1 cup light ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>2 cups coarsely shredded carrots</li>
            <li>2 cups coarsely chopped zucchini</li>
            <li>1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><h5>Step 1</h5>
                <p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bit, about 8 minutes. Drain</p>
            </li>
            <li><h5>Step 2</h5>
                <p>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p>
            </li>
            <li><h5>Step 3</h5>
                <p>Melt margarine in a skillet over low heat; cook and stir flour, salt, and pepper into the melted margarine until smooth and bubbling, 2 to 3 minutes. Add milk and broth into flour mixture, stirring constantly; bring sauce to a boil. Stir wine into sauce and remove from heat. Stir Parmesan cheese into sauce until smooth.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h5>Step 4</h5>
                <p>Whisk ricotta cheese, egg, and egg white together in a bowl.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h5>Step 5</h5>
                <p>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; saute carrots, zucchini, and spinach until just becoming tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir vegetable mixture into ricotta mixture.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h5>Step 6</h5>
                <p>Layer 1/3 the lasagna noodles, 1/3 the ricotta-vegetable mixture, and 1/3 the Parmesan sauce in a 9x13-inch baking dish; repeat layering 2 more times with remaining ingredients, ending with a layer of mozzarella cheese.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h5>Step 7</h5>
                <p>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is lightly browned and bubbling, about 30 minutes.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
