        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Made with shredded chicken, tender basmati rice, and smoky-sweet, caramelized onions and peppers, this chicken rice-a-roni was inspired by a Lebanese rice and vermicelli pilaf. Garnish with fresh herbs, lemon juice, chili flakes, hot sauce, or even garlic-infused yogurt!</p>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><h5>Step 1</h5>
                <p>Place chicken, celery, carrot, onion, and bay leaf in a stockpot and cover with water. Set over high heat, add salt, and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until the thighs and legs can be pulled easily from the carcass, about 1 hour and 15 minutes. Remove chicken to a bowl, carefully tipping the carcass to drain any broth from the cavity back into the stockpot.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h5>Step 2</h5>
                <p>Let meat sit until it's cool enough to handle, 15 to 20 minutes. Separate skin, bones, and meat. Set aside 2 cups shredded meat (white, dark, or a combination of the two) for rice-a-roni and reserve the rest for another use.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h5>Step 3</h5>
                <p>Transfer skin and bones back to the stockpot with the broth and simmer for 1 to 2 hours or until you need it. Strain.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h5>Step 4</h5>
                <p>Combine oil and butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. When hot and melted, add onion, bell pepper, and salt. Cook and stir until onion just starts to turn translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Add broken spaghetti and cook until toasted and light golden brown to dark brown in color, about 3 minutes; it's okay if the onions and peppers start to caramelize.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h5>Step 5</h5>
                <p>Add rice and stir until completely coated. Add pepper, oregano, cumin, and saffron. Stir in 3 1/2 cups chicken broth. Add cayenne, garbanzo beans, peas, and shredded chicken and return to a simmer.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h5>Step 6</h5>
                <p>Cover tightly with a lid, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook for 15 minutes; do not lift the lid or stir during this time.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h5>Step 7</h5>
                <p>Remove the lid and check the rice in a couple spots. It should be just barely tender. (If it seems undercooked, you can cover and cook for a few more minutes.) Replace the lid, turn off the heat, and let rice sit for 10 minutes.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h5>Step 8</h5>
                <p>Sprinkle parsley and cilantro over top and stir to combine. Check for seasoning and serve immediately.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Chef's Note:</h4>
        <p>You can use leftover chicken and store-bought broth if you'd like, instead of making your own!</p>
        <p>Any long-grain white rice can be used instead of basmati.</p>
